The todo list is a list of features I know would be good
but don't have time to figure out.  Patches welcomed.

Disable auto-play from within the movie.  It's possible to
configure the quicktime pluging using html, but that
requires an extra page.

Enable fast-start -- playing the movie before it's fully
downloaded.

Auto-detect image resolution, replacing -8 or -1.

Automaticaly locate the keynote-sprt.dat file.

Synthesize the relevant parts of the remaining keynote
sprite.

Support audio narration for each slide in lieu of pausing.
